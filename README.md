# Hi there 👋

# Welcome to My GitHub! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
Hey! I’m diving into web development, data analysis, and soon, data science. Currently learning how to turn chaotic data into something meaningful without any Severance style memory wipes (fingers crossed).

## **🛠️ Tech Stack:**

Web Dev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (I swear, I’ll get the hang of it soon)

Data Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQL

Data Science (coming soon): Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## **📈 Current Projects:** 

Designing data dashboards

### Let's connect and share ideas! 💬

Fun Fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading a Margaret Atwood dystopia. Guess I have a thing for imagined futures—just hoping mine’s not as chaotic as The year of the flood.
